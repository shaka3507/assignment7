## Questions

1. Javascript object feels the most useful to use - the methods available to it feel the most accessible in terms of readibility. Associative array syntax and even JSON syntax seems to have more structure. For example JSON needs double quotes for strings, and JS objects can take single or double quotes. This makes sense since JSON is used as an intermediary between many languages (for APIs), so more structure and a standard is needed.
2. The easiest part of this assignment was adding the coordinates via hard coding them HTML. I decided to do it this way because the grid size was already determined and having it already apart of the HTML id was potentially more performant than adding a for loop in JS to add those div ids.
